  - Utility [ buckets, ... ]
  - Backpacks
- Stack to 32

## Salvage Mod

> Take those old unused items like backpacks and break them down into something useful again

\_Dev Note : Return 60%-ish of materials, don't do this for everything. **DO NOT TOUCH ITEMS WITH DURABILITY**

---

## Class "Rebalance"

> Modify the vanilla classes <br>

_Dev Note : More of a test on modifying classes than a true rebalance_

- Make all classes feel unique
- Class interplay for multiplayer servers
- Everyone gets 2 unique crafts
  - 1 cosmetic craft
  - 1 USEFUL functional craft

---

## New Class : This game is hard

> Stand alone class mod. Designed to make the game generally easier in all aspects for those that are bad at survival games and/or just want an easier time but not set mobs to passive.

- Class Name : Rugged Survivor
  - Bonuses
  - Penalties
    - No unique crafts

## "Level UP" Addon - GUI Tweak

> Tweak the Level Up GUI to display what the actual bonuses are. Possibly on moust-over of the displayed level <br>
> ~TKSAdlam

_Dev Note : Not sure if mouse over is supported. If not modify GUI to display bonuses as subtext_
